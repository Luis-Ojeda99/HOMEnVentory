# HOMEnVentory
This project was created by Luis Ojeda.

## Description
The HOMEnVentory website is created with the purpose of helping anyone to keep track of their inventory for everything that they have at home.

The users can register and log in with an user and password of their preference, and then they can add all the items that they want to keep track of. They can change the category, name or price of their items as much as they like. Furthermore, they are also able to change any account information that they need to such as their names, email or password. In case of a forgotten password,  the user can recover it by following the link that will be sent to their email. Lastly, should the user want to stop  using the application, they can deactivate their accounts so no one can log in again. if they want to re-activate their account, they should contact an page administrator. The administrator users themselves are able to manage all the information of the users (but the password, which is encrypted), and new users.

This application with Python using a Django framework with a MTV (Model-Template-view) pattern.
